APP_LOGO="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38027416?v=4"
# The name of the app.
APP_NAME="Oh My Polisher"
# Summary your app's behavoir and show the users how to use it.
APP_SUMMARY="Correcting and polishing your text."
# Example input that shows user how to use the app.
EXAMPLE_INPUT="Hello there, im Nooc, it's glad to see you."

# Server side

# Required, the API key got from OpenAI (https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-XXXXXXXXX"
# Optional, the agent server of OpenAI API. Use this when the offical OpenAI API server is unreachable.
OPENAI_API_BASE_URL=""
# Optional, the system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. (Learn more from https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/introduction)

```

You can edit the example file located in the root directory of this project named `.env.example`. Once you have made the necessary changes, you can then copy and paste the entire content of the file into the "Environment Variables" input field on the Vercel console.


### Generating custom widgets
1) Use this phrase with Project Atlas in Cheat Layer to generate custom front end UIs: 

```generate a website with a professional looking form that contains 1 input. It submits an object {input: value} to /api/request. The result is available in data as a string. Print the result in a div. Do not use sendAjax and use fetch. Make it look fancy.```
2) Create a new .html file in the /public directory, like test.html. Open the HTML file Cheat Layer downloads and copy/paste the HTML from that. 
3) Click commit changes, and wait on vercel dashboard for the auto-deploy to test the new version!


### Embedd the wiget
1) Take the URL of the widget, and put it inside this code:
```
<iframe src="WIDGET_URL" width="100%"></iframe>
```
